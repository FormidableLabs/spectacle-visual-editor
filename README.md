<h2 align="center">Spectacle Visual Editor</h2>

Spectacle Visual Editor is a platform for building Spectacle decks visually using built-in Spectacle elements and templates created by the Formidable design team. The first phase of the project is building the visual editor using React, [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) and [Segment Evergreen](https://evergreen.segment.com/components/). The second phase of the project will be adding a server-platform for users to store, host, and generate one-page outputs of their decks. A goal is also for users to be able to collaborate on a single link and make updates.

## Getting Started with UI Editor
